# About fARmework #

## What is it? ##

This is an augmented reality framework developed for Android OS powered devices. The framework core functionality consists of:

  * **client-server bus** allowing Android application to send and receive data from/to a Java server (bidirectional communication involving sockets),
  * lightweight, extendable **Java server**,
  * augmented reality modules:
    * **AR graphics view** 3D object presentation and positioning fixed to the North direction,
    * **location module** tracking device's position and finding direction between points,
    * **screen gestures** recognition of gestures drawn by user on device's screen,
    * **space gestures** recognition of gestures drawn with the device in mid-air.

## The name ##

Initially, the project meant to be a port of hare-and-hounds game into augmented reality. However, growing number of code lines and new ideas made us change our mind and convert it into a framework, having changed initial hare-and-hounds game concept into a sample implementation of the game using our framework. Therefore, the proper name of the project would be **fARmework**.

## Goal ##

The project is developed as a part of B.Sc. thesis on Warsaw University of Technology.
