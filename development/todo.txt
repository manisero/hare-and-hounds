- ContextManager should keep Activities stack - this will allow to finish the application programatically (invoking Finish method on every activity)

- ViewModel should be able to finish the activity

- register Context in DI container this will allow to resolve some Context-dependent objects per request (instead of as eager singletons)

- HareAndHounds: allow the server to take Hare name and positions from xml file (so that only one device / emulator is needed to play)

- mark all dependencies as final

- remove unused android:id attributes form lauouts
