1. Third party libraries:
   Is it possible to keep third party libraries outside of the projects?
   E.g. the projects could have relative references to "fARmework/third_party" folder.
   
   EDIT:
   No, it's not. Android SKD requires the libraries to be located in "[project name]/libs"
   folder.
